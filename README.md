This is a part of the paper "Unmasking the conversation on masks: Natural language processing for
topical sentiment analysis of COVID-19 Twitter discourse". The major works I contributed were experiments aiming to determine the best value of k for the primary topic clusters and subclusters yielded by Râ€™s k-means algorithm for our topic-modeling task. At the same time, she verified the correctness of the summaries generated from the DistilBart text summarization tool used to describe the resulting clusters.
